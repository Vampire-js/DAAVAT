#  AI-Powered Lecture Summarizer & Note Generator  
###  Lecture-to-Knowledge Pipeline for Smarter Learning

---

## 📖 Project Description

Students and self-learners often struggle with slow manual note-taking, passive learning from lengthy lectures, and fragmented tools for revision, quizzes, and doubt-solving. Transforming long lecture videos into structured notes requires repeated effort and reduces engagement, retention, and efficiency.

Our solution introduces an **AI-powered Lecture-to-Knowledge Pipeline** that converts raw lecture videos into clean, structured, and visually enriched study material — automatically.

The system treats a lecture as a **single source of truth** and generates multiple learning artifacts, including:

-  Structured summarized notes  
-  Key concept extraction  
-  Auto-generated quizzes  
-  Visual summaries and diagrams  
-  Intelligent doubt-solving assistant  
-  Unified manual + automated note-taking workspace  

This enables faster revision, better understanding, and improved knowledge retention — all within one integrated platform.

##  Technical Approach

The system leverages modern AI and NLP technologies:

-  Speech-to-Text (STT) for lecture transcription  
-  NLP-based extractive and abstractive summarization  
-  Semantic search using sentence embeddings  
-  Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent doubt resolution  
-  Modular, plugin-based backend architecture  
-  Scalable and extensible pipeline design  

The architecture is designed to support live and recorded lectures, future multilingual expansion, and institutional-level deployment.
